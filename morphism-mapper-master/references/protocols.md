# Execution Protocols

## Phase 0: Context Anchoring (User Profile)
- **Identity**: Who is the user?
- **Resources**: What cards do they hold?
- **Constraints**: What are the red lines?

## Phase 1: Category Extraction
Identify:
- **Objects (O)**: Nouns, entities.
- **Morphisms (M)**: Verbs, relationships.

## Phase 2: Domain Selection
Select Domain B where `Distance(A, B) > 0.7`.

## Phase 3: Functorial Mapping
Map $F: A 	o B$ such that $F(f \circ g) = F(f) \circ F(g)$.

## Phase 4: Synthesis & Check
**Commutativity Check**:
1. Does the solution violate A's axioms?
2. Is the structure preserved?
