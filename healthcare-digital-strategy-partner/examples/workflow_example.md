# Deep-Dive Example: The "Digital Airspace" Economy

## Task 1: Retrieval Output (Excerpt from task1_retrieval_output.md)
- **Data Point 1**: CAGR of 22.8% in low-altitude logistics drones (2024-2030). Source: CAAC Internal Forecast.
- **Data Point 2**: 5G-A (Advanced) infrastructure investment requirement estimated at $4.2B per tier-1 city. Source: Huawei/MIIT.
- **Conflict**: Local governments promote "Vertiports," but current battery energy density (250Wh/kg) limits range to <30min, making most planned routes economically unviable without 400Wh/kg breakthrough.

## Task 2: Analysis Expansion (Excerpt from task2_analysis_draft.md)
### Chapter 3: The Energy Density Chokepoint
The narrative of "urban air mobility" faces a physics-induced bottleneck. While software for ATC (Air Traffic Control) is ready, the energy density of solid-state vs. liquid batteries dictates a "Survival Path" focused on last-mile delivery rather than human transport.
**Causal Chain**: 
Lower Energy Density -> Reduced Payload -> High Cost/Weight Ratio -> Market focus shifts to High-Margin medical/urgent delivery (survival path) -> Wait for 450Wh/kg breakthrough for "Golden Path" (mass transport).

## Task 3: Editor's Forging (Excerpt from final_research_report.md)
- **Refinement**: Upgraded "Battery problem" to "Energy Density Chokepoint".
- **Logic Check**: Added a paragraph on how regional policy subsidies are temporarily masking the energy cost inefficiency, providing a more realistic "Gray Reality" view.
